    "In summary \n",
    "    - Confidence intervals are an example of a missleading and inconsistent interpretation of uncertainty\n",

    "    - frequentists assume fixed parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ given a model, which are then evaluated w/ hypothesis tests. This rigid approach forces to induce fixed uncertainty (using sampling) and use conf ints that have the limitation of ruling out whatever doesn't fit our model.\n",

    "### 3.8.4 Connection between cross validation and marginal likelihood\n",
    "- We can draw parallels between the frequentist cross-validation and Bayes model selection\n",
    "    - frequentist CV - splits $K$ validation subsets, then use $K-1$ in training and the $K$-th one for testing\n",
    "    - Bayes model selection offers two similar flavors close to this concept:\n",
    "        - **leave-one-out CV (LOO-CV)** sets each measurement $K=N$ such that: $p_{\\text{LOO}}(m)=\\sum_{n}^{N}\\log{p(\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\mid\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}(\\mathcal{D}_{-n}),m)}$, where the $\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}(\\mathcal{D}_{-n})$ is the estimate when we ommit the $n$-th measurement (see Sec.3.8.6)\n",
    "        - **log evidence/marg-likelihood** is yields a similar expresion to LOO. Where, from $\\operatorname{LML}(m)=\\log{p(\\mathcal{D}\\mid m)}$, then using a point esimate ($\\delta(\\vec{\\theta}-\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}(\\mathcal{D}_{1:n-1})$) LML simplifies to: $\\log p(\\mathcal{D} \\mid m) \\approx \\sum_{n=1}^N \\log p\\left(\\mathcal{D}_n \\mid \\hat{\\vec{\\theta}}\\left(\\mathcal{D}_{1: n-1}\\right), m\\right)$, w/ the difference that this is evaulated sequentially $(\\mathcal{D}_{1: n-1})$\n",
    "- However, both methods have the problem that because the prior is weak, they overfit for the early training folds and can't generalize well for the latter points\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.8.5 Conditional marginal likelihood\n",
    "- Marginal likelihood answers the Q: *what is the likelihood of generating training data from my prior?*\n",
    "    - this framing is useful for hypothesis testing, not so much for slecting models based on their posteriors\n",
    "    - overfits first examples and fails to generalize well for the latest ones (weak prior)\n",
    "    - early overfitting can even be negatively correlated to generalization [[Lot+22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/lotfi22a.html)]\n",
    "- **Conditional log Marginal Likelihood (CLML)** asks: *what is the probability that a posterior could generate data points from* $\\mathcal{D}$ ?\n",
    "    - defined as: $\\operatorname{CLML}(m)=\\sum_{n=K}^{N}\\log{p(\\mathcal{D}_{n}\\mid\\mathcal{D}_{1:n-1},m)}$\n",
    "    - where $K$ is a parameter to the algorithm (if we set $K=N-1$, we are back to the LOO estimate)\n",
    "    - CLML generalizes better and is less sensitive to prior hparams\n",
    "    - is straightforward to 'Monte-Carlo'-estimate the integral, sampling from the posterior $p(\\vec{\\theta}\\mid\\mathcal{D}_{<n})$\n",

    "### 3.8.7 Information criteria\n",
    "- An alternative to cross-validation for model selection is to score models based on the negative log-likelihood (NLL) PLUS some criteria (represented as complexity terms $C(m)$): $\\mathcal{L}(m)=-\\log{p(\\mathcal{D}\\mid\\hat{\\vec{\\theta}},m)}+C(m)$\n",
