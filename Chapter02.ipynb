    "### 2.6.1 Parametrization\n",
    "#### 2.6.1.1 Markov transition kernels\n",
    "- A **transition function / kernel / Markov kernel** is just a conditional dist $p(x_t | x_{t-1})$ that depends on the last state. It satisfies the Kolgomorov axioms\n",
    "- If we assume that the transition function is *time-independent* then the model is said to be **homogeneous, stationary, or time-invariant**\n",
    "- The assumption of modeling an arbitrary number of variables w/ fixed number of params is called **parameter typing** (time-invariant is an example of this)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.1.2 Markov transition matrices\n",
    "- This section deals with discrete vars $X_t \\in {1, \\ldots, K}$ called **finite-state** Markov chain\n",
    "- The conditional dist can be written as a $K \\times K$ transition matrix $A_{ij} = p(X_t=j | X_{t-1}=i)$ gives the prob of going from state $i$ to state $j$ (each row sums to 1, this is called a **stochastic matrix**)\n",
    "- Now we want to get from state $i$ to state $j$ in $n$ steps, what is this prob? Thanks to **Chapman-Kolgomorov** equations this is just powering up a transition matrix $n$ times\n",

    "    - $\\mathbf{A}(n) = \\mathbf{A}^n$\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2.6.1.3 Higher-order Markov chains\n",
    "- We can generalize the last case to higher dimensions ie. a model of order w/ memory length $n$, called **Markov model of order n / n-gram model**:\n",

    "    - If $n=1$ this is called a **bigram model** (because we need to represent pairs of chars $p(\\vec{x}_t\\mid\\vec{x}_{t-1})$), $n=2$ is trigram (we need to represent triplets $p(\\vec{x}_t\\mid\\vec{x}_{t-1},\\vec{x}_{t-2})$), and so on …\n",
    "- A powerful property is that we can always convert higher-order models to first-order by defining an augmented state space\n",
    "    - eg. for an $n=2$ bigram model, we can define: $\\tilde{\\vec{x}}_t=(\\vec{x}_{t-1},\\vec{x}_t)$\n",
    "    - and then use: $p(\\tilde{\\vec{x}}_{1:T})=p(\\tilde{\\vec{x}}_2)\\prod_{t=3}^T p(\\tilde{\\vec{x}}_t\\mid\\tilde{\\vec{x}}_{t-1})$\n",

    "- Will see how to estimate params of a Markov model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.3.1 Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)\n",
    "- The main idea behind MLE is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data from a probability function\n",
    "- Since Markov models have previous states as parameters then its transition matrix contains all the useful info. So MLE is used to estimate the transition states\n",
    "- Remember that this is basically maximizing the log prob\n",
    "    - eg. for order 1: $p(x_{1:T}|\\vec{\\theta}) = \\pi(x_1)A(x_1,x_2)\\ldots A(x_{T-1},x_T)$ (notation in Markov models: $\\pi(x)=p(x)$)\n",
    "    - This can be  written w/ prods $\\prod$ (eq.2.275) and then generalized to $\\mathcal{D}=(\\vec{x}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{x}_N)$ where the chain $\\vec{x}_i$ is $\\vec{x}_i=(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{iN})$ \n",
    "    - After taking the log and defining counts we arrive to eq.2.276: $\\log p(\\mathcal{D}|\\vec\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^N\\log(p(\\vec{x_i}|\\vec{\\theta}))=\\sum_jN^1_j\\log\\pi_j+\\sum_j\\sum_kN_{jk}\\log A_{jk}$ \n",
    "        - $N_j^1$: represents the number of transition states where state $j$ is the starting state\n",
    "        - $N_{jk}$: number of transition states from $j$ to $k$ (**bigram statistics**)\n",
    "        - $N_j$: number of times state $j$ is involved in a state transition (**unigram statistics**)\n",
    "    - Then we maximize the log likelihood using *Lagrange multipliers* and find the estimates for Markov models: $\\hat{\\pi}_j=\\frac{N_j^1}{\\sum_{j^\\prime}N_{j^\\prime}^1}$ and $\\hat{A}_{jk}=\\frac{N_{jk}}{N_j}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2.6.3.2 Sparse data problem\n",
    "- If we want to fit n-gram models (past state memory) to text data, for large $n$ we face huge overfitting problems due to sparsity (most words in any training dataset are not linked)\n",
    "- Thus if we have a chain of length $K$ (# words in dataset), and context $K^{n-1}$ (**context** / past states), then we'll have a sparse matrix of $K\\times K$, beacuse most $N_{jk}$ are zero\n",
    "- Brute force attempts to overcome this have been used in the past [[HNP09](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf)], but ideally we wouldn't like to NOT be able to predict a particular word just because it is not in our training set\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.3.3 MAP estimation\n",
    "- A simple initial solution to the sparsity problem is to use the *Dirichlet prior* $\\mathbf{A}_{j:}\\sim \\text{Dir}[\\alpha\\mathbf{1}]$\n",
    "- The Maximum a Posteriori MAP estimate for transition states is $\\hat{A}_{jk}=\\frac{N_{jk}+\\alpha}{N_j+K\\alpha}$ (if $\\alpha=1$ is called **add-one-smoothing**)\n",
    "    - The problem with add-one-smoothing is that it assumes that all n-grams are equally likely (not realistic)\n",
    "    - More sophisticated approach in Sec.3.7.3, hierarchichal Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6.4 Stationary distribution of a Markov chain\n",
    "- Stationary distribution = prob dist that remains unchanged over time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.4.1 What is a stationary distribution?\n",
    "- The stationary distribution has the interpretation of the limiting distribution when the chain is irreducible and aperiodic\n",
    "- The formulation is as follows: \n",
    "    - the **stationary / equilibrium distribution** case is when (eg in the 1-step transition-mat case) $\\vec{\\pi}_t = \\vec{\\pi}_{t-1}\\mathbf{A}$ reaches $\\vec{\\pi} = \\vec{\\pi}\\mathbf{A}$ after some iterations, regardless of the initial state dist (eg. prob of being in state $j$ at time $t$ $\\pi_t(j)=p(X_t=j)=\\sum_{i}\\pi_{t-1}A_{ij}$)\n",
    "    - In general we have the **global balance equations** $\\pi_i\\sum_{j\\neq i}A_{ij} = \\sum_{j\\neq i}\\pi_jA_{ji}$, subject to normalized marginal probs ($=\\sum_j\\pi_j=1$), so the prob of being in state $i$ times the net flow out of state $i$ must equal the probability of being in each other state $j$ times the net flow from that state into $i$\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2.6.4.2 Computing the stationary distribution\n",
    "- The whole thing above is similar to solving an eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{A}^T\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}$, where we need to set $\\vec{v}^T=\\vec{\\pi}$ \n",
    "    - $\\vec{v}$ is an eigenvector w/ eigenval = 1, it exists because $\\mathbf{A}$ is a row-stochastic-mat ($\\mathbf{A1}=\\mathbf{1}$) and eigenvalues for $\\vec{A}, \\vec{A}^T$ are the same\n",
    "- However we have a few caveats\n",
    "    - can't handle transition probs equal to 1 or 0, because eigenvectors are only guaranteed to be real-valued if all entries are $A_{ij} > 0$ (and hence $A_{ij} < 1$)\n",
    "    - a trick is to generalize the eigenvalue problem using the constrains \n",
    "        - $K$ constraints in $\\vec{\\pi}(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})=\\mathbf{0}_{K\\times 1}$\n",
    "        - 1 constraint in $\\vec{\\pi}\\mathbf{1}_{K\\times 1}=1$\n",
    "    - now we need to compute $\\vec{\\pi}\\mathbf{M}=\\vec{r}$ (where $\\mathbf{M}=[\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{1}]$, $\\vec{r}=[0,\\ldots,0,1]$) then drop the last column of $\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}$ and the last zero of $\\vec{r}$ to fix the unscontraint-problem given the size of $M$ being $K\\times (K+1)$\n",
    "- Unfortunately not all chains have stationary dists\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.6.4.3 When does a stationary distribution exists\n",
    "- Few definition of terms\n",
    "    - **regularity** a Markov chain that converges to a stationary state. The way to prove this is to find only positive entries in the transition matrix in a finite number of steps\n",
    "    - **irreducible** necessary condition to have convergence to a *unique stationary state*, where it is possible to reach any state from any other state in a finite number of steps, ie. all states communicate with each other\n",
    "    - **aperiodic** is a sufficient but not necessary condition to ensure that state $i$ has a self-loop\n",
    "- *Theorem 2.6.1.* Every irreducible (singly connected), aperiodic finite state Markov chain has a limiting distribution, which is equal to $\\pi$, its unique stationary distribution.\n",

    "#### 2.6.4.4 Detailed balance\n",
    "- Because establishing *ergodicity* is difficult we can use an alternative (easier to verify) condition:\n",
    "    - A **time reversible** Markov chain has **detailed balance equations**: $\\pi_iA_{ij}=\\pi_jA_{ji}$, so the flow from $i$ to $j$ must equal the flow from $j$ to $i$, weighted by the appropriate source probabilities\n",
